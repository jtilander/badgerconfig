Automatically generates Visual Studio project and solution files from a custom set of configuration files. Unlike other programs that are makefile generators, these set of scripts are focused on making it easy to manage large amounts of projects and apply the same settings across the board.

It also differs in the way it generates the .vcproj files, instead of building in all the smarts and mimicking the functionality of visual studio itself, it simply does a textual replacement of a template .vcproj file that the user sets up beforehand. This can be translated into any other project format, e.g. Makefiles and nant.



Also, note that if you need to download a pre-zipped file of all the source, since Google doesn't allow downloads from their source projects anymore, you can use this link instead:
